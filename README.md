# SoupedUpDropDownList

This is a Flex 4.5 library project containing a custom implementation of the Spark DropDownList.

The SoupedUpeDropDownList contains two main features:

1. A built-in button which allows the user to clear the selection in the drop down list.
2. Shows validity indications in the component by highlighting the component in different colors, green for "valid" and red for "error".
